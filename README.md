I guess you working on some project and you got a moment that you think this functionality is already implemented somewhere.
Searching code snippet in large code base is a nightmare (unless it is well documented and structured).
DevNote is a platform to save code snippets for with tags. So Whenever you come accros a fancy CSS dialog implementation you've already done once, you can just search that with a tag say "Jquery" or "Bootstrap", it's easy that way. Isn't it?
